COVID'19 MASK DETECTOR  

COVID'19 Pandemic impacted everyone and many people have lost their life. So as a student it's our responsiblity to help our country with small contribution. I hope our small contribution will help in quick recovery from the pandemic situation.  


PROBLEM: Second wave of COVID'19 is very dangerous and many innocent public are loosing their life. Although majority of our crowd is taking all the precautionary measures but still there are some segment of audience who are not wearing mask and it is becoming very difficult for our Police Department to handle those careless crowd.


IDEA: We can add this software alongwith Traffic Signals and those who will found without mask in public, automatically the fine will be imposed and the fined amount will get deducted from their account. This will help our Government to control the public of India who are not taking COVID'19 Pandemic seriously.
